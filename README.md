# MoneyMap: Semantic Financial Flow Engine 🚀

> Advanced graph-based anomaly detection for financial transaction networks

## 🔍 Overview

MoneyMap is an intelligent financial flow analysis system that leverages graph machine learning to detect suspicious transaction patterns and potential fraud in complex financial networks.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Transaction Network Analysis**: Transform raw transaction data into meaningful financial graphs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns using graph embedding techniques
- **Temporal Analysis**: Sliding window approach for time-sensitive financial flows
- **Visual Insights**: Built-in visualization tools for financial network exploration

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoneyMap-Semantic-Financial-Flow-Engine.git
cd MoneyMap-Semantic-Financial-Flow-Engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from preprocessing.data_loader import load_transaction_data
from graph.graph_converter import FinancialGraphBuilder

# Load sample transaction data
transactions = load_transaction_data("data/sample_transactions.csv")

# Build financial graph
graph_builder = FinancialGraphBuilder()
financial_graph = graph_builder.build(transactions)

# Analyze graph properties
print(f"Graph contains {financial_graph.node_count} entities")
print(f"Graph contains {financial_graph.edge_count} transactions")
```
