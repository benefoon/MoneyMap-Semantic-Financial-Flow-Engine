# 💠 MoneyMap: Semantic Financial Flow Engine  

> **A next-generation AI system for understanding, mapping, and detecting anomalies in financial transaction networks using graph intelligence and semantic embeddings.**

---

## 🧭 Overview  

**MoneyMap** is a high-level **graph-based financial intelligence system** designed to uncover hidden transaction patterns, detect anomalous behaviors, and provide a semantic understanding of financial flows.  
By integrating **graph machine learning, embedding-based reasoning, and temporal analytics**, MoneyMap serves as an advanced platform for **fraud detection, AML monitoring, and risk analysis** in large-scale financial ecosystems.

## ✨ Core Capabilities  

| Capability | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🕸️ **Graph-Based Modeling** | Converts transactional data into directed, weighted financial graphs with entity-level and edge-level semantics. |
| 🔍 **Anomaly Detection Engine** | Detects suspicious flows via graph embeddings (GCN, GAT, Node2Vec) and unsupervised models (GraphAE, DOMINANT, GDN). |
| 🧠 **Semantic Reasoning Layer** | Embedding-driven detector that captures contextual irregularities in money movement (semantic outlier detection). |
| 🕓 **Temporal Flow Analysis** | Sliding window mechanisms and recurrent graph tracking for evolving transaction behaviors. |
| 📊 **Visual Financial Intelligence** | Built-in visualization of entities, relationships, and anomaly clusters for interpretable insights. |
